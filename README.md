## ðŸ”° Introduction

In todayâ€™s increasingly digital ecosystem, attackers are shifting away from manual hacks toward **automated threats** that exploit web applications at scale. To address this, **OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)** released the **Automated Threats to Web Applications (OATv2)**, which identifies **21 critical automated threats** that security professionals must understand, monitor, and mitigate.

These threats are often carried out using bots, scripts, and headless browsers, targeting business logic vulnerabilities and operational gaps in web applications.

## ðŸš¨ Breakdown of Each Threat (Expanded)

### **OAT-001: Carding**
